/// nobody has put one in — therefore throws out of a path whose whole job is to produce a frame.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The <c>characters</c> view did exactly that: it guarded the loop that opened the two sessions and
/// then indexed <c>_config.Worlds[0].Characters[0]</c> unguarded on the line after, to pose the frame.
/// A guard on one indexer and not its neighbour is how this arrives, so this walks <em>every</em> view
/// rather than the one that was reported — the sibling views (<c>quit</c>, the MSSP screen,
/// <c>ActiveWorldIndex</c>) were each already careful, and this is what keeps them that way.
