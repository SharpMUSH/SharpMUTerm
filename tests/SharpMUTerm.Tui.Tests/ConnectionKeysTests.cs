/// The dedicated chords for Reconnect and Disconnect: ⌥D drops the focused character's connection and
/// ⌥R drops and redials it, both at once and neither asking anything.
/// <para>
/// <b>They share a modifier, and that is the point of the pair.</b> Disconnect was ⌃D — "⌃D is the
/// terminal's own hang-up chord" and "Alt+R is one modifier over from ⌃R" being two separate
/// justifications bolted together, each fine alone and jointly making a reader learn two modifiers for
/// one concept. It was reported as exactly that: "It's 'CTRL-D' to disconnect, but 'ALT-R' to reconnect?
/// Why are they not both under Alt?" ⌃D is released rather than kept as a second binding, because a
/// second key for one action is either a secret or a duplicate row on every surface that lists chords.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The claim that needs proving first is that the chords <em>arrive</em>. Both are ESC-prefixed
/// printables (<c>1b 64</c> and <c>1b 72</c>, read off a pty), so both survive SharpConsoleUI's input
/// parser — unlike ⌃I/⌃M/⌃J/⌃H, which collapse onto Tab, Enter and Backspace and have already cost this
/// client four features. The second is that they act on the connection in the window <em>in front of
/// you</em>: nothing asks before either of these runs, so a session resolved from <c>_active</c> rather
/// than the focused window would drop the wrong world's connection on one keystroke and say nothing
