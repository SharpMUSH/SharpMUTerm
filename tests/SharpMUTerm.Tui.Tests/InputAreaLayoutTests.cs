/// <summary>
/// What the window actually gives the input area, in rows.
/// <para>
/// <see cref="InputLayoutTests"/> covers the arithmetic — how tall a bar wants to be for a given text
/// at a given width — and every one of those assertions passes whatever the window then does with the
/// answer. That is the gap these close: a bar's height is a <em>request</em>, made in
/// <see cref="InputBarControl.MeasureDOM"/>, and SharpConsoleUI grants it in
/// <c>WindowContentLayout</c>, which reserves the sticky bands before the workspace is measured at all
/// and applies no minimum of its own. A bar that asks for three rows and is arranged at none is a
/// disagreement no arithmetic test can see, so these read the granted number back off the arranged
/// controls — and then check the frame carries that many rows of each bar's band, because "the second
/// bar's tone appears nowhere" is the form the defect gets reported in.
