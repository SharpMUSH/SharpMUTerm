/// was in front of them: "I am looking for the characters to have different numbers? Am I not

/// in front.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>2. The digits re-base per character.</b> ⌥1 is <em>this</em> character's own window whoever you
/// are, ⌥2 their first capture. Globally numbered, three characters sharing pane 1 as tabs all read
/// <c>⌥1</c> on the sidebar, and nine digits do not stretch over everybody's windows. Characters are
/// reached by the ⌥J/⌥K cycle instead. The fixture puts a capture <em>second</em> in creation order on
/// purpose, so the window digits are not the pane digits wearing a new name.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>3. The number is the number on the screen.</b> Windows are counted in <c>WindowsFor</c> order,
/// which is exactly the set and order the rail draws window rows in — so the assertions read the label
/// off the <em>live rail</em> and press the digit that label names, rather than writing down which
/// window ought to be second. A chord that lands somewhere other than the label says is worse than no
/// chord, and this repository has already paid for two spellings of one thing once
/// (<c>▪ main   main</c>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>4. It is the full activation, on painted cells.</b> "Bring it forward" is not <c>FocusedPaneId</c>
/// being assigned: it is the window active in its pane's strip, that pane's plane on the frame, and the
/// command line talking to its character. All three are asserted, the plane off the frame the driver was
/// handed — a focus indicator can be set on a control arranged at zero rows and read back happily.
/// </para>
