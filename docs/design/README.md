# Handoff: SharpMUTerm multi-pane workspace, spawn windows & settings (M5 UI)

## Overview

A design for SharpMUTerm's TUI shell at M5 scope: a tmux-style pane tree hosting BeipMU-style
spawn windows, a worlds→characters connection model, trigger sets assignable to characters,
a searchable command surface, and per-tab input drafts.

This covers the UI layer only. It assumes the existing `SharpMUTerm.Core` engines
(`TriggerEngine`, `AliasEngine`, `IntervalScheduler`, `ScrollbackBuffer`, `SessionManager`)
and asks for two **schema changes** in `SharpMUTerm.Core.Configuration` — see *Schema changes* below.

## About the design files

`SharpMUTerm-TUI-v3.dc.html` is a **design reference written in HTML**, not production code and not
something to port. It is a browser mock of a terminal UI: every "pane border", "block meter"
and "box-drawing glyph" is HTML standing in for what SharpConsoleUI will draw as real cells.

The task is to **rebuild these screens in `SharpMUTerm.Tui`** using SharpConsoleUI views and the
existing `Theme`/`ColorMapper` pipeline. Do not translate the HTML structure; translate the
layout, the interaction model, and the information hierarchy.

Open the file in a browser to interact with it (typing, pane splits, ⌃P, F2–F9 all work).

## Fidelity

**High-fidelity for layout, interaction and information architecture. Deliberately
low-fidelity for colour.**

Every colour in the mock is a literal hex, because HTML has no theme layer. In the real client
these must resolve through `SharpMUTerm.Core.Theming.Theme` — do not hardcode the mock's hexes.
The mapping table under *Design tokens* gives the theme field or ANSI index each mock colour
stands for.

Everything else — pane geometry, tab strip behaviour, key bindings, what text appears where,
truncation and overflow rules — is intended as specified.

## Schema changes (required before the UI can be built)

Two model gaps between the design and `main`:

### 1. Worlds have characters; a character is the connection

Today `WorldDefinition` carries connection parameters *and* is itself the connection unit.
The design separates them: a world is a **server** (host/port/TLS/encoding), and it holds
**zero or more characters**. A character is what you connect *as* — sessions are keyed
`<world>.<character>`, and one world can have several sessions live at once.

```csharp
public sealed class CharacterDefinition
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "New Character";
    public string? Password { get; set; }          // [JsonIgnore]: lives in secrets.json (see below)
    public Guid? PasswordRef { get; set; }         // the secrets.json key; meaningless on its own
    public string? ConnectString { get; set; }     // template; null → "connect %CHARACTER% %PASSWORD%"
    public bool ConnectAtStartup { get; set; }     // open this connection at launch — see below
    public string? OnConnect { get; set; }         // ';'-separated commands
    public string? OnDisconnect { get; set; }
    public List<string> TriggerSets { get; set; } = new();  // set names, see below
    public LoggingSettings Logging { get; set; } = new();   // per character, not per world
}
```

`WorldDefinition` keeps `Name/Host/Port/UseTls/AllowInvalidCertificates/LocalEcho` and gains
`List<CharacterDefinition> Characters`. `Triggers`/`Aliases`/`Macros`/`ScriptFiles` move off it
(see below). A world with zero characters is valid and must render as such — it just cannot connect.

`SessionManager.Open` should take `(WorldDefinition, CharacterDefinition, int scrollbackLines)`
and key sessions on `$"{world.Name}.{character.Name}"`.

#### `ConnectAtStartup` opens the socket; the login follows from the fields

There used to be a second boolean here, `AutoLogin`, and it was a trap. The connect line was sent only
when it was on, so a character with a **saved password** and that flag at its default connected and
then typed nothing — a stored credential doing nothing, silently. Worse, the flag was not reachable:
the F5 form drew it as a well-less readout (correctly meaning "not editable here") and the checkbox it
was a readout *of* was bound on the character row but never rendered. Nobody could have turned it on.

It is gone. What a character types at a login prompt is now **derived** from the fields it already has
— `CharacterDefinition.Login()` returning a `LoginPlan`:

| | what it decides | when it applies |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectAtStartup` (F5 `at start`) | whether a socket is opened at all, unasked | client launch |
| `Login()` (F5 `login`, read-only) | what is typed: a saved `Password` **or** an explicit `ConnectString` means send | once a connection exists |

**A saved password is the instruction to log in.** The way to say "leave it to me" is to save neither a
password nor a connect line; the way to log into a passwordless world is to write a connect line
(`connect %CHARACTER%`). The one remaining way to be inert — a saved password whose connect line has no
`%PASSWORD%` in it — is `LoginPlan.PasswordUnused`, and it is reported in `Warn` ink on F5 and printed
into the session at connect, because a configuration that cannot work must never be silent.

Migration v3 → v4 drops `autoLogin` from every character. `false` is discarded (it is the default
nobody chose, and honouring it would preserve the trap); `true` with no password and no connect line is
preserved by writing `connectString: "connect %CHARACTER%"`, the line it was already sending.

Auto-connecting a character whose login you type by hand is normal; so is a character that logs
itself in whenever *you* choose to dial it. `StartupConnections.Resolve` is the single place that
answers "what does this launch connect": a host on the command line wins outright, else every marked
character in configuration order, else **nothing** — the client opens with no connection and says so.
Zero, one or several may be marked; the first in configuration order takes the main window and is
focused, later ones each get a tab, and the sockets are dialled concurrently so one dead host cannot
hold the others up.

It lives on the character rather than as a `WorldDefinition` pointer naming one, so it cannot dangle
when a character is renamed or removed. It defaults to `false` with **no migration**: before it
existed the client dialled the first world's first character unconditionally, and reinstating that
would re-impose it on the users who never chose it.

#### Passwords live in `secrets.json`, not in `config.json`

Character passwords are saved — a client that forgets them is a client whose users type credentials into
the command line, where they are echoed, written to the session transcript and offered to history. But they
are **not saved in `config.json`**, because that is the file people share: it goes into bug reports, help
channels, screenshots and dotfiles repositories.

So there are two files, side by side in `~/.config/SharpMUTerm/`:

| File | Holds | Mode | Safe to paste? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config.json` | worlds, characters, trigger sets, preferences — and a per-character `passwordRef` GUID | left as found | **yes** |
| `secrets.json` | `{ "<guid>": "<password>" }`, nothing else | `0600` | **no** |

`CharacterDefinition.Password` is `[JsonIgnore]`; `CharacterDefinition.PasswordRef` is the GUID that
reaches the config, and it carries no information — a shared config discloses that *a* password exists and
nothing more. `ConfigurationStore.Save` and `.Load` are the only code that knows a reference stands for a
password; everything upstream reads and writes `Password`.

**This is not encryption, and does not pretend to be.** The passwords are plaintext in a JSON file, as
hand-editable as the config, and anyone who can read the file can read them. Obfuscation was considered and
rejected: the key would ship inside the client, so it stops nobody holding the file, while making the field
look protected and adding a permanent migration burden. What the split buys is that *accidental disclosure*
and *deliberate sharing* stop being the same action, which is the failure that actually happens. What the
mode buys is that "anyone who can read the file" is one account. An OS credential store
(DPAPI/Keychain/libsecret) is the thing that would make these secrets at rest; it remains a legitimate
future option and nothing claims it exists today.

The rules, all of which exist so that nothing on this path can stop you logging in:

- **No secrets file until there is a secret.** A user who has saved no passwords has no `secrets.json` at
  all — the same principle as the scrollback spill only creating its cache on the first eviction. Blanking
  the last password deletes the file again.
- **Everything degrades to "no password".** A missing file, an unparseable one, a key that is not a GUID, a
  reference with no matching row: all mean the character has no stored password. The client starts, and
  `connect %CHARACTER% %PASSWORD%` sends `connect <name>` — the template already drops one adjacent space
  for an empty token. A file that exists and could not be read is reported **once**, at startup, to the
  client message log (Ctrl+P); never per keystroke.
- **Owner-only, tightened silently.** Every write narrows `secrets.json` to `0600` first, creating it with
  that mode rather than chmodding after, so no window exists in which a world-readable file holds a
  password. An existing wider file is narrowed in place without asking: the condition is fixed by the time
  anyone could be told, and refusing to write would lose passwords over a permission bit. On Windows there
  is no equivalent step — the file inherits `%APPDATA%`'s user-only ACL, and hand-rolling a DACL no CI here
  can exercise would trade something correct for something untested.
- **Orphans cannot accumulate.** The file is rewritten from the characters that exist, so deleting a
  character deletes its row. There is no separate sweep to get wrong.
- **A duplicated character gets its own row.** `Clone()` copies `Password` and deliberately does *not* copy
  `PasswordRef`, so the next save allocates a fresh GUID. Sharing a row would mean editing one character's
  password silently changed the other's, invisibly, behind two masks. `Save` also refuses to let two
  characters share a row, so the intent and the enforcement are separate and agree.
- **A secrets file that cannot be read is moved aside, not overwritten.** It becomes
  `secrets.json.unreadable` before anything replaces it, because the client is about to write a map that
  demonstrably does not contain those passwords.

**No migration is needed.** `passwordRef` is a new optional property with a null default, and `Password`
was never serialized, so there is nothing on disk to convert: an existing v2 document simply has no
reference, which means "no stored password" — the same state the user was already in. `CurrentVersion` does
not move, because it exists for renames and restructures, not for additive optional fields.

### 2. Triggers live in named sets, assigned to characters

Today `WorldDefinition.Triggers` is a flat per-world list. The design makes automation a
first-class, world-independent library:

```csharp
public sealed class TriggerSet
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "New Set";
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public List<Trigger> Triggers { get; set; } = new();
    public List<Alias> Aliases { get; set; } = new();
    public List<Macro> Macros { get; set; } = new();
    public List<string> ScriptFiles { get; set; } = new();
}
```

`AppConfiguration` gains `List<TriggerSet> TriggerSets`. A character's `TriggerSets` names
select which apply. `TriggerEngine` for a session is composed from the union of its character's
sets — so a "Comms" set can be shared by every character on every world, and a "Trade" set can
be live for one character and dark for another on the same world.

`BeipMuImporter` should emit one set per imported world (named after it) and assign it to that
world's imported character, preserving today's behaviour.

`Trigger.Actions.SpawnTarget` already exists and is what the routing UI edits — no change needed.

---

## Screens

### 1. Main workspace

The whole client. Five regions, top to bottom: header, [rail | pane area], input, status bar.

**Header** (1 row): `☰ muterm` at far left is the menu affordance and opens the command
surface (the caret flips `☰`→`▾` while open). Right side carries a `⌃B` prefix indicator
(shown only while armed, and replacing the rest of the row while it is), the log indicator
(`◉ LOG 1284` / `◉ LOG off`), and a clock.

**Connection rail** (left, ~204px ≈ 25 cols expanded / 46px ≈ 6 collapsed): a two-level tree.

```
┌ CONNECTIONS
▚ Aetherfall
  aetherfall.mux:4201
  ▸ ● Corvid                    3
      ▪ main              p1
      ▪ #public        ✎  3  p2
      ▪ pages             p3
      ▪ +who              p1
    ○ Rookery
▚ Nightmarket
  nightmarket.org:6250
    ○ Sparrow                   2
      ▪ main           closed
      ▪ #trade            2  p2
```

World header carries the world accent as a left spine on the active group. Characters indent
one level with a connected dot (`●`/`○`) and an active marker (`▸`). Windows indent again,
showing unread count, a `✎` if they hold unsent input, and which pane hosts them (or `closed`).
Worlds with no characters print `no characters` rather than rendering empty.

Collapsed (⌃B b, or click the header) it becomes a 46-col strip: per-world separator glyph,
then character initials with status dot and unread count. Clicking still switches character.

**Pane area**: a recursive split tree. Each pane is a bordered box containing a tab strip and
an output view; the focused pane's border takes its character's accent colour.

Tab strip: one tab per window hosted in that pane. Each tab shows a colour dot (its character's
accent), the window name, unread count, `⌁` if the window belongs to a *different* character
than the one currently focused, and `✕` on the active tab only. Tabs keep natural width and the
strip scrolls horizontally when they overflow, with a `»N` counter on the right. Right of that:
`▯▯` split-right, `⌸` split-down, `⤢` zoom.

Spawn windows used to show their capture pattern under the strip as a dim `⇱ capture ^\[public\]`
line. **They no longer do** — it was asked for and removed, and a spawn window now renders exactly
like any other output window. Which rule feeds a pane is F2's answer, not the pane's.

Output view: timestamp column (optional), then styled spans. Trigger-highlighted lines get a
2-col left rule in the trigger's colour plus a tinted background.

Freezing (⌥F) splits the pane horizontally: frozen scrollback above under a
`▲ FROZEN ⌥F` bar, live tail below.

**Input** (grows, min 3 rows): prompt reads `Corvid@aetherfall ›` — bound to the focused
**character**, not the focused pane. Right gutter shows the destination window (`→ main`),
a `✎ pages #public` list of other windows holding drafts, character count, and spellcheck state.

**Status bar** (1 row): connection state, `HP ████░░░░ 78`, `EN ███░░░░░ 54`,
`keepalive ▁▃▅▇ ack 41ms`, then host / encoding / `⌃P palette`.

### 2. Command surface (⌃P, or the header menu)

One surface for both mouse and keyboard; there is no separate menu.

Search field on top (`› type to search commands, windows, characters…`) with a match count
(`12 of 41`). Under it a context strip naming the character every command will act on.
Results are grouped `├ GO TO` / `├ WORLD` / `├ TERMINAL` / `├ LAYOUT`, and ↑↓ walks the
flattened list across group boundaries. ⏎ runs, Esc closes.

The catalog is generated from live state, not static: every non-focused character is a
`Switch to Rookery` entry, every window a `Go to #public` entry subtitled with its owner and
unread count, and stateful commands read their current value (`Pause logging`,
`Unzoom pane`, `Resume scrollback`).

Ranking: substring match beats fuzzy subsequence; a prefix match on the command name ranks highest.

On a narrow terminal it docks to the bottom; otherwise it floats near the top.

### 3. Worlds & Characters (F5) — full screen

Not a dialog. Worlds list on the left (name, address, character count, live count) with
`[+ world]` and, under it, a row naming what `Del` would take (`Del  removes Aetherfall`). Right side,
top to bottom:

- **Header**: world name, address, TLS state, encoding.
- **`├ WORLD`**: name, host, port, security, encoding, keepalive — right-aligned labels,
  bordered value cells.
- **`├ CHARACTERS`**: a table — name, state (`● connected` / `○ offline`), login mode,
  assigned trigger sets — with `[+ add character] [⧉ duplicate]` and the same `Del` row. Empty state:
  *"no characters — this world has nothing to connect with."*
- **`└ CHARACTER · <name>`**: two columns. Left: name, password (masked, *saved in secrets.json,
  plaintext*), the connect-line template (`connect %CHARACTER% %PASSWORD%`), on-connect, `at start`,
  `login` (derived, read-only), session state, log format + folder, `restore`, and `tint` — the colour
  this character's panes are painted in, chosen from a closed list of six names (plus `None`, the
  default, which leaves the pane on the theme's own surface). It colours the **command line** as well, so
  a glance at the bar says whose connection `⏎` is aimed at. All six tints sit at one luminance — no
  character's pane is brighter than another's — one step below the untinted surface, because a MU\*'s own
  bright ANSI is read on that plane and the games are written for black terminals; the bar takes the hue
  without the step, since brightness there already says which of the two command lines is armed. The
  focused pane is still the brighter one, whatever colours are in play. Right: the trigger-set checklist — each row is
  `[x] ▪ Comms — channel + page routing    2 rules`. Toggling assigns/unassigns live.

Footer: `[Esc] Close` and, on the right, whatever `⏎` does on the row the cursor is on (`Edit`, `Add`,
or `Done`).

**Editing is applied immediately, and closing keeps it.** A committed value — `⏎` on a field, `Space` on a
checkbox, a `[+ …]` press — is written to `config.json` as it is made, so `Esc` and the screen's own F-key
are navigation and not a transaction: neither discards anything. `Esc` is layered, backing out one level
per press: inside a field it abandons the buffer (which config never saw) and leaves the cursor on the
row; on the row it closes the screen. The one exception is a **deletion**, whose subject cannot be
retyped: those are logged, and closing a screen that made any asks once, naming each of them, with *keep*
as the default. There is no save key and no `⌃S` — see `ScreenEdits` for the whole rule.

### 4. Triggers & spawn routing (F2)

Two columns. Left: the rule list — enable checkbox, name, pattern, owning set (`▪ Comms`),
and action flags. Right: the editor for the selected rule — pattern field, a **route-to**
list (main inline, or any spawn window), colour swatches, and `[x] highlight line` /
`[x] play sound` / `[ ] gag line`. Editing is live: change a pattern and the next matching
line routes differently.

### 5. Other dialogs

`F3` aliases · `F4` keypad & hotkeys (3×3 keypad grid + binding list) · `F6` timers ·
`F7` text & ANSI · `F8` input & spellcheck · `F9` logging. All are checkbox-list or
table layouts in the same frame; F7/F8/F9 share one options-list body.

## Interactions

### Pane management (tmux-style prefix)

`⌃B` arms a prefix — the header shows `⌃B — awaiting | - z o x b m i < > ← → · Esc cancels` — and
the next key acts:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `\|` | split focused pane vertically, moving its non-active tabs into the new pane |
| `-` | split horizontally, same rule |
| `z` | zoom / unzoom focused pane |
| `o` | cycle pane focus |
| `x` | close the focused tab (the main window stays) |
| `b` | collapse / expand the connection rail |
| `m` | enter **move mode** |
| `i` | show / hide this window's second command line |
| `<` `>` (or `←` `→`) | reorder the active tab within its pane |
| `Esc` (or `⌃B` again) | cancel |

Splitting moves the *other* tabs across rather than duplicating the active one — the common
case is "pull #public out into its own pane".

Which means a pane holding a single window **cannot** be split, and on a fresh client that is the
whole workspace: `|`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `z` and `o` all have nothing to do. Each of them **says so on
the status line** rather than leaving the keystroke looking dead — that silence is what made the
prefix read as broken the first time it was used in a real terminal.

**The keymap explains itself: which-key, not a setting.** The strip above is the whole of what an
armed prefix used to show, and it names ten keys to anyone who has already read the source. So
arming now starts a short timer as well (`SharpMUTermApp.PrefixPanelDelay`, 400 ms, on the injected
clock): if no key has arrived by the time it fires, `PrefixOverlay` floats a panel naming what each
key *does*. That is vim's which-key and emacs' guide-key, and it is deliberately not the
modal-versus-strip preference that was asked for — an expert never sees the panel because their
second keystroke has already landed, a newcomer is told without having to ask, and neither has to
find a setting. It must be a *timer* rather than anything hung off a frame: an armed prefix changes
nothing, so repaints stop.

The panel shows the commands that **cannot** run dimmed, beside the short reason (`needs a second
pane`), so it explains the workspace as well as the keymap; pressing one anyway still spells the
refusal out on the status line. Both lengths of every reason live in `PrefixPanel`, which is also
where the strip's spellings live — the strip is picked to fit the room the identity ribbon leaves,
because the header is one row and an overlong one *wraps*, which costs a row of workspace.

The prefix is left the way every other surface in this client is left: `Esc`, or `⌃B` again. Both
are advertised on both surfaces, and neither may leave the prefix armed — a prefix nothing can
consume eats the next keystroke, and if that keystroke is `x` a window closes. The same rule is why
arming is ignored during a move (`HandleWindowKey` tests move mode first) and why every other
claimed chord cancels a pending prefix before opening its own surface.

### Move mode (`⌃B m`) — the keyboard path for window placement

Drag is an accelerator, not the only route. Move mode: the active window lifts, every pane dims
and shows its own number (`1`–`9`, the same ordinal the sidebar labels it with and `⌥N` jumps to),
and the status bar becomes the prompt
`MOVE #public → split pane 2 right · 1–9 pane · ←↑↓→ edge · ⏎ commit · Esc cancel`.

- `1`–`9` or Tab picks the destination pane
- arrows or `hjkl` toggle an edge (splits there instead of adding as a tab); pressing the same
  edge again clears it
- ⏎ commits, Esc cancels

The edge preview reuses the same highlight the drag path draws.

### Mouse

Drag a tab (or a window from the rail) onto a pane: drop in the middle to add it as a tab,
drop within 25% of an edge to split there. Pane dividers drag to resize (min 14% per side).
This requires SGR mouse reporting (modes 1002/1006) — note it degrades on some SSH stacks,
which is exactly why move mode exists.

### Per-tab input drafts

Each tab owns its input buffer. Switching tabs parks the typed text with the tab it was written
in and presents the new tab's buffer; switching back restores it verbatim. Sending clears only
that tab's buffer. Closing a tab keeps its buffer for when the window reopens.

History recall must not destroy a draft: `↑` stashes the live draft before the first recall,
`↓` past the newest entry restores it, and editing a recalled line re-bases it as the draft.
While recalling, the gutter shows `history · ↓ back to draft`.

Held drafts are visible, not silent: `✎` on the tab, `✎` in the rail, and a
`✎ pages #public` list in the input gutter.

### Trigger routing

A line is matched against the union of the session character's trigger sets. First `Gag` wins
and drops the line. Otherwise highlights accumulate, and the last matching `SpawnTarget`
decides the destination window. A line routed to a non-visible window increments its unread
count on the tab, the rail character, and the rail world.

### Other keys

`⌃P` command surface · `⌥F` freeze/resume in focused pane · `⌃L` toggle logging ·
`⌃Tab` next tab in pane · `⌃R` reconnect · `↑`/`↓` history · `F2`–`F9` config · `Esc` close overlay ·
`Shift+Enter` newline in input.

---

## State

Per application:

- `layout` — the pane split tree: `{t:'s', dir:'row'|'col', sizes:[a,b], kids:[…]}` interior
  nodes, `{t:'p', id, tabs:[windowId], active}` leaves. Pruning rule: a pane with no tabs is
  removed, and a split left with one child collapses into that child.
- `focus` — pane id; `conn` — focused session id (`world.character`)
- `zoom` — pane id or null
- `frozen` — per-pane bool
- `drafts` / `stash` — per-window input buffers and the pre-recall stash
- `hIdx` — history cursor, reset to -1 on any tab or pane switch
- `move` — `{windowId, from, target, edge}` while move mode is active
- `railOpen`, `palette` + query + selection, `dialog` / `screen`

Per window: `{id, sessionId, name, kind: main|chan|page|spawn, capturePattern, lines[], unread}`.

## Design tokens

The mock's palette is a stand-in. Map it through `Theme` rather than copying hexes:

| Mock hex | Role | Resolve via |
|---|---|---|
| `#0b0e14` | app background | `Theme.Background` |
| `#c8d0dd` | body text | `Theme.Foreground` |
| `#12161f` | status bar bg | `Theme.StatusBackground` |
| `#8b93a5` | status bar text | `Theme.StatusForeground` |
| `#1e2532` / `#2e394d` | pane + dialog borders | `Theme.Border` |
| `#63c8d8` | accent, prompt, focus ring | `Theme.Prompt` |
| `#98c379` | connected, character names, HP | `Theme.SystemMessage`, ANSI 2 |
| `#8b93a5` on echo | local echo | `Theme.LocalEcho` |
| `#e5c07b` | unread, warnings, patterns, move mode | ANSI 3 |
| `#e06c75` | disconnected, errors, destructive | ANSI 1 |
| `#c678dd` | frozen-split chrome, channel captures | ANSI 5 |
| `#e58fb0` | pages / whispers | ANSI 13 |
| `#d19a66` | poses, second world accent | ANSI 11 |
| `#5b6577` / `#404b5e` / `#3f4859` | dim text, section labels, disabled | derive from `Theme.Foreground` |

Per-world accent colours should be a `WorldDefinition.Accent` field (an ANSI index or `Rgb`),
not hardcoded — the design leans on them to keep windows traceable to their owner once they
scatter across panes.

**Character cells, not pixels.** All mock dimensions are px against a 13px monospace grid;
divide by ~8 for columns, ~20 for rows. Rail 204px ≈ 25 cols expanded, 46px ≈ 6 collapsed.
Header/status/input rows are 1 row each. Minimum pane after a split ≈ 14% of its parent.

**Glyphs used:** `▚ ▸ ▪ ● ○ ✎ ⌁ ✕ ⇱ ▯▯ ⌸ ⤢ ⤡ ▲ █ ░ ▁▃▅▇ ┌ ├ └ »`. All are in the common
box-drawing/geometric ranges; `⌁` and `⇱` are the least safe — substitute if MTTS reports a
narrow charset.

**No rounded corners, gradients, or shadows anywhere.** The mock had them early and they were
removed deliberately: the design must read as a terminal.

## Assets

None. No images, no icon fonts — glyphs only.

## Files

- `SharpMUTerm-TUI-v3.dc.html` — the interactive design reference (open in a browser)
- `support.js` — runtime for the above; not part of the design

Repo files each screen maps to are tabulated in `github.md` at the project root.

## Suggested PR breakdown

1. **Schema** — `CharacterDefinition`, `TriggerSet`, `AppConfiguration.TriggerSets`,
   `SessionManager` keying, `BeipMuImporter` update, migration from v1 config. Tests only.
2. **Pane tree** — split tree model + Terminal.Gui view hosting, dividers, zoom, `⌃B` prefix.
3. **Tab strips & spawn routing** — per-pane tabs, unread, `TriggerEngine` `SpawnTarget` → window.
4. **Rail** — worlds/characters/windows tree, collapse.
5. **Input** — per-tab drafts, draft-safe history, `✎` indicators.
6. **Move mode + mouse drag**.
7. **Command surface**.
8. **Settings screens** — F5 full screen, then F2–F9.

Steps 1 and 2 are the load-bearing ones; everything after is additive.
