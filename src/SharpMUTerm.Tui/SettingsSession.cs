/// <b>Esc is layered, and the layering is a rule about scope rather than two special cases:</b> it backs
/// out of one level of nesting per press, and it discards only work that has not been confirmed. Inside a

/// closes the screen, reverting nothing, because everything still on the screen was confirmed by the ⏎
/// that committed it. The one exception is a deletion, whose subject cannot be retyped, and the host asks
