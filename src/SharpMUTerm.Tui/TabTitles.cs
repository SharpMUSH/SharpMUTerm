/// Formats a window's tab-strip label from its <see cref="WorkspaceWindow"/> state: the title, an
/// unread badge like <c>(3)</c> while the tab is in the background, a <c>✎</c> pen when it holds an
/// unsent input draft, and a <c>⌁</c> when the window belongs to a <em>different</em> character than
/// the one currently focused. Pure so it can be unit-tested without a terminal.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>A tab title is markup, not plain text.</b> This file used to say the opposite, and the claim
/// had a cost: it is why the unread count went out untinted and why a window title was never escaped.
/// <c>TabControl.Rendering</c> runs each label through <c>MarkupParser.Parse</c>, and every width it is
/// measured by — the header paint, the strip's desired width, and the click hit test that decides which
/// tab and which <c>×</c> a press landed on — is <c>MarkupParser.StripLength</c>. So a colour tag here
/// costs <em>no cells</em> and moves no hit test, which is what makes the activity tint affordable on a
/// surface where a cell may not be spent.</para>
/// <para>It also means configured and world-supplied text has to be escaped on the way in
/// (<see cref="MarkupText.Escape"/>): a window titled <c>[Chat]</c> — or a web view titled from the page
/// it loaded — would otherwise have that eaten as a tag by the parser and by the hit test alike.</para>
/// <para>The focused <em>pane</em> is marked by the <c>▌</c> this emits plus the lit plane it is painted
/// on (<see cref="WorkspacePalette.Focus"/>), because a pane cannot be given a border without changing
/// its rectangle and so the per-pane NAWS size it reports. The <c>▌</c> is deliberately left
/// <em>outside</em> the activity tint: focus and activity are independent, a tab can have both, and a
/// marker that changed colour when a line arrived would be reporting the wrong fact.</para>
/// <para>The close affordance is deliberately <em>not</em> here. A <c>✕</c> written into the label is
/// just text: the framework's tab hit test sees it as part of the title and a click on it merely
/// selects the tab. The real close button is <c>TabPage.IsClosable</c>, which the framework draws
/// itself and hit-tests into <c>TabControl.TabCloseRequested</c> — see
/// <c>SharpMUTermApp.BuildPaneTabs</c>.</para>
