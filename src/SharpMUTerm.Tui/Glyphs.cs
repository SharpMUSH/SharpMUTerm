/// <summary>
/// Centralised Nerd Font (v3) icon glyphs for SharpMUTerm's chrome. The terminals SharpMUTerm targets
/// (Kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty) are routinely run with Nerd Font builds, so these icons render as
/// crisp symbols there; on a plain font they degrade to a "tofu" box. Keeping them in one place
/// means a future MTTS-driven fallback to plain geometric glyphs is a single-file change rather
/// than a hunt through every renderer.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Codepoints are the FontAwesome-in-Nerd-Fonts private-use range (expressed as escapes so the
/// source stays ASCII-clean). The plain glyph each replaces is noted for an easy fallback set.
