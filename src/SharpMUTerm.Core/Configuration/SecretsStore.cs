/// <para>
/// <b>Why two files.</b> Character passwords have to be saved — a client that forgets them is a client
/// whose users type credentials into the command line, where they are echoed, transcribed and offered to
/// history. But <c>config.json</c> is the file people <em>share</em>: it goes into bug reports, help
/// channels, screenshots and dotfiles repositories, and a secret in it leaks the first time anyone asks
/// "what does your config look like". So the secret is not in it. Config carries
/// <see cref="CharacterDefinition.PasswordRef"/>, a GUID that means nothing on its own, and the value it
/// stands for lives here. Pasting a config now leaks a hostname and a character name, which is what a
/// config is for.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this is not.</b> It is not encryption, and it does not pretend to be: the passwords are
/// plaintext in a JSON file, exactly as hand-editable as the config, and anyone who can read the file can
/// read them. What the split buys is that accidental disclosure and deliberate sharing stop being the same
/// action — which is the failure that actually happens to people. What the file mode buys is that "anyone
/// who can read the file" is one account. Reversible obfuscation would buy neither and would cost a
/// permanent migration burden plus a field that looks protected and is not. An OS credential store is the
/// thing that makes these secrets at rest, and the live client uses one where the machine has it
/// (<see cref="CredentialVault"/>); this file is what holds a password when there is none, or when the store
/// refuses it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Everything degrades to "no password".</b> A missing file, an unparseable one, a key that is not a
/// GUID, a reference with no row: all of them mean the character has no stored password, the client starts,
/// and <c>%PASSWORD%</c> resolves to nothing (which <see cref="ConnectStringTemplate"/> already handles by
/// dropping one adjacent space). None of it is an error that blocks a login, because a client that refuses
/// to connect over a permission bit on a convenience file is worse than one that asks for the password
/// again.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>No file until there is something to put in it.</b> A user who has saved no passwords has no
