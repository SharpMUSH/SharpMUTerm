/// </para>

/// <item><b>It is what keeps the config document shareable.</b>
/// <see cref="CharacterDefinition.ConnectString"/> <em>is</em> serialized. A password baked into the line
/// therefore lands in the one file the whole storage design exists to keep free of secrets — so the token is
/// not merely tidier than a literal, it is the difference between a config that can be pasted into a bug
/// report and one that cannot.</item>
/// <item><b>One home for the secret.</b> A password baked into the line is a second copy in a second
/// field, and the two silently disagree the moment either is edited. The token means the password lives in
/// the password field, full stop.</item>
/// <item><b>The password field is masked; the connect line is not.</b>
/// <see cref="CharacterDefinition.ConnectString"/> is drawn in the clear on F5, in snapshots and in
/// screenshots, because it is an ordinary text field and has to be readable to be editable. A secret in it
/// is a secret on screen.</item>
/// <item><b>Substitution at send time keeps the resolved line off every local surface.</b> Typed input is
/// offered to <c>InputHistory</c> and to local echo, which hides recognized credential commands
/// from the output and transcript. The configured login line goes straight out through
/// <c>SendRawAsync</c> with no echo, no transcript write and no history entry. That is unchanged by
/// where the password is stored.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// The rules, all four of them decided here so every caller and every test reads the same ones:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Delimiters.</b> <c>%NAME%</c>, both ends. One spelling, so a line cannot half-look like a
/// token.</item>
/// <item><b>Case.</b> Token names are matched case-insensitively (<c>%Password%</c> works), the same way
/// trigger-set names and every field choice in this app are matched. The canonical spelling is upper
/// case and that is what the default and the UI show. A token the user plainly meant, left unrecognised,
/// would be sent to the server as literal text and invite them to "fix" it by pasting the real password
/// into the line — which is the thing this type exists to stop.</item>
/// <item><b>Escaping.</b> <c>%%</c> is a literal <c>%</c>. So <c>%%PASSWORD%%</c> sends the seven
/// characters <c>%PASSWORD%</c> and substitutes nothing.</item>
/// <item><b>Unknown tokens are left verbatim.</b> <c>%PASWORD%</c> is sent as typed. It is the
/// conservative rule — only what is recognised is rewritten — and the visible one: the server refuses
/// the login and the line that did it is still readable. Stripping it would send a login line silently
/// missing its password, which on many servers connects you as a guest instead of failing.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// <b>Empty values</b> get one narrow rule: a token that resolves to nothing also takes one adjacent
/// space with it — the space before it if there is one, else the space after — so
/// <c>connect %CHARACTER% %PASSWORD%</c> with no password sends <c>connect Corvid</c> with no dangling
/// space, exactly as the old hand-built line did. Nothing else is collapsed and the result is not
/// trimmed, because a template with no tokens in it must come back byte-identical: people have working
/// configs, and a whitespace rule applied to the whole line would quietly rewrite them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A substituted value is <b>never rescanned</b>: a password of <c>50%%off</c> or even
/// <c>%CHARACTER%</c> is inserted as it stands. Substitution is one left-to-right pass over the

/// and any caller that could not supply a world would emit the token verbatim to the server. A token
/// that resolves at one call site and leaks its own name at another is a worse contract than a token
/// that does not exist. If a world-level token is ever wanted, the shape is a resolution context the
