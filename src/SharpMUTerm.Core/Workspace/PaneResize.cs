/// split running in that axis is the one that moves. When no ancestor does, there is genuinely no border
/// to move, and the caller is expected to <em>report</em> that rather than swallow it: a key that changes
/// nothing and says nothing is indistinguishable from one that is not bound.

/// sentence is true from either side of the split. It used to be true only of the horizontal pair: the
/// vertical arrows read as "move the border that way", so with the <em>bottom</em> pane focused ↑ made
/// it shorter, and the answer to "what does ⌥⇧↑ do" needed to know where in the tree you were standing.
